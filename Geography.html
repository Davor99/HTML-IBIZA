     <strong>Ibiza</strong> is a rock island covering an area of 572.56 square kilometres
      (221.07 sq mi), almost one-sixth the size of Majorca, but over five times
      larger than Mykonos in the Greek Isles, or 10 times larger than Manhattan
      in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" target=_blank"">New York City</a>.

      Ibiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called
      the Pityusic Islands (Pitiusas) or "Pine Islands" composed of itself and
      Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of
      which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa,
      also known as Sa Talaia or Sa Talaia de Sant Josep at 475 metres (1,558
      ft).

  <h1><strong></strong>Ibiza</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <strong>Ibiza is a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast
      of the Iberian Peninsula.</strong> It is 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of
    Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands in area, but the
    second-largest by population. Its largest settlements are <strong>Ibiza Town</strong>,
    Santa Eul√†ria des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point,
    called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is 475 metres (1,558 feet) above sea
    level.

  <p>
   <em> <strong>Ibiza</strong> is well known for its nightlife and electronic dance music club
    scene in the summer, which attract large numbers of tourists. The island's
    government and the Spanish Tourist Office have worked toward promoting
    more family-oriented tourism.</em>

    <strong><strong></strong>Ibiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ibiza and the nearby island of
      Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or "Pityuses".</strong>

  <h2>Names and pronunciation</h2>
  <p>
    Phoenician colonists called the island Ibossim or Iboshim (cf. Hebrew
    ◊ê÷¥◊ô÷æ◊ë÷º◊ï÷π◊©÷µ◊Ç◊ù, "Fragrance Island"), likely due the abundance of aromatic
    plants on the island.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other speculation is (Phoenician: ê§Äê§âê§Åê§îê§å,  æYB≈†M, "Dedicated to Bes"). It
    was later known to Romans as Ebusus.
  </p>
  <p>
    he Greeks called the two islands of <strong>Ibiza</strong> and Formentera the Pityo√ªssai
    (Œ†ŒπœÑœÖŒø·ø¶œÉœÉŒ±Œπ, probably meaning "Pine-Covered Islands").The Catalan name
    Piti√ºses and the Spanish name Pitiusas retain this Greek root.
  </p>
  <p>Its name in Catalan is Eivissa.The Spanish name is <strong>Ibiza</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    In the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and
    especially to the Royal Navy as Ivica, possibly from an older Spanish
    orthography with

  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>
    In 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on <strong>Ibiza</strong>. With the decline
    of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, <strong>Ibiza</strong> came under the control of
    Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt,
    fish sauce (garum) and wool.
  </p>
  <p>
    A shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave
    at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's
    commercial orbit after 400 BC. <strong>Ibiza</strong> was a major trading post along the
    Mediterranean routes. <strong>Ibiza</strong> began establishing its own trading stations
    along the nearby Balearic island of Majorca, such as Na Guardis, and "Na
    Galera" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as
    slingers, to fight for Carthage.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio
    brothers (Publius and Gnaeus) in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage.
    With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, <strong>Ibiza</strong> was
    last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian general Mago to gather
    supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. <strong>Ibiza</strong>
    negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared <strong>Ibiza</strong>
    from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic
    institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when
    it became an official Roman municipality.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first
    Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Muslims in
    902. The few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came
    in. Under Islamic rule, <strong>Ibiza</strong> (Yabisah) came in close contact with the
    city of D√©nia‚Äîthe closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in
    the Valencian Community‚Äîand the two areas were administered jointly by the
    Taifa of D√©nia for some time (11th century).

  <h4>World Heritage Site</h4>
  <p>
    Though primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island
    are registered as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site" target="_blank"> World Heritage Sites</a>
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>A notable example includes the Renaissance walls of the old town of <strong>Ibiza City</strong>, which were awarded UNESCO World
    Heritage Status in 1999. They are one of the world's few Renaissance walls that were not demolished, and part of the
    medieval wall is still visible. There are some <strong>Ibizan</strong> cultural sites, such as the remains of the first Phoenician
    settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but
    this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to
    preserve this wetland. The oceanic plant Posidonia oceanica is also part of UNESCO's World Heritage.</p>
